# Phaser-game

The CORS will block the program from being run in a normal browser so in order to bypass this:
1. Install python if you haven't already
2. cd into the directory you are working in (the Phaser-game file)
3. In the command prompt/terminal type "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"
4. In the browser URL type "127.0.0.1:8000"
